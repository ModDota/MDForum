# MDForum

This is a project to get a few nice features together into one forum.

1. Extreme CDN-orientation. Ideally, there should be virtually nothing that needs to actually hit the server on normal requests.
2. Multiple language support, with translators. The idea behind this is to allow translators to contribute translations on posts, making it possible for translator-assested multi-language discussions.
3. Simple. In theory a forum system shouldn't be terribly complex to implement, so this should be easyish.
